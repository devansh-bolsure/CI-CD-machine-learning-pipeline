# Drug Classification ML Pipeline with CI/CD Automation

Built and deployed a machine learning pipeline for drug classification using Python, scikit-learn, and SKOPS. Automated the end-to-end workflow with GitHub Actions for CI/CD, generating evaluation reports via CML, and deploying the model and application on Hugging Face Spaces. Utilized tools like Gradio for UI, Makefile for task automation, and Hugging Face Hub for cloud model hosting. Focused on production-readiness, reproducibility, and continuous integration.
